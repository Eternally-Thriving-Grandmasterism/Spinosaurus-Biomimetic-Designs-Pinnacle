## Spinosaurus Biomimetic Design Applications Lattice

1. Amphibious Propulsion: Tail undulation + paddle limbs → hybrid actuators (Optimus water ops, underwater drones)
   Efficiency gain: 30–50% in variable media

2. Adaptive Thermal Structures: Neural sail → deployable radiators / morphing solar surfaces (Starship, Tesla solar)
   Benefit: Passive cooling + variable geometry

3. Buoyancy Control: Dense bones + shunt → variable-density systems (submersibles, Mars probes)
   Advantage: Lightweight depth stability

4. Pressure Sensing: Rostral pits → gradient arrays (turbid navigation, Mars atmosphere)
   Application: Low-visibility flow detection

5. Stability & Hydrofoil: Sail + tail → adaptive control surfaces (marine craft, drone wings)
   Advantage: Pitch/roll/yaw in dynamic flow

All under MIT—fork freely, attribute appreciated.
